How much will Jack pay back?\n\nSolution:", "\nSince Jack is borrowing money from Jill, the interest he has to pay back is a portion of his original amount. The interest rate in this case is a percentage of 10%, which is a simple interest rate. The formula for calculating the interest is:\n\nInterest = Principal x Rate x Time / 100\n\nIn this case, the principal amount is $1200, the rate of interest is 10% or 0.10, and the time period is not mentioned, so we'll assume it to be one year for the sake of calculation.\n\nTherefore, the interest amount will be calculated as:\n\nInterest = $1200 x 0.10 x 1 / 100\n\nInterest = $1200 x 0.01\n\nInterest = $120\n\nTherefore, Jack has to pay back $120 to Jill as well as the original $1200.\n#### 120\n</s>", "<s>, \u2581[, M, ATH, _, T, AS, K, ], \u2581Problem, :, <0x0A>, Jack, \u2581and, \u2581J, ill, \u2581are, \u2581friends, \u2581who, \u2581borrow, \u2581from, \u2581each, \u2581other, \u2581often, ., \u2581Last, \u2581week, \u2581Jack, \u2581borrow, ed, \u2581, \u2581$, 1, 2, 0, 0, \u2581from, \u2581J, ill, ,, \u2581which, \u2581he, \u2581promised, \u2581to, \u2581pay, \u2581back, \u2581with, \u2581an, \u2581interest, \u2581of, \u2581, 1, 0, %., \u2581How, \u2581much, \u2581will, \u2581Jack, \u2581pay, \u2581back, ?, <0x0A>, <0x0A>, Sol, ution, :", "<0x0A>, Since, \u2581Jack, \u2581is, \u2581borrow, ing, \u2581money, \u2581from, \u2581J, ill, ,, \u2581the, \u2581interest, \u2581he, \u2581has, \u2581to, \u2581pay, \u2581back, \u2581is, \u2581a, \u2581portion, \u2581of, \u2581his, \u2581original, \u2581amount, ., \u2581The, \u2581interest, \u2581rate, \u2581in, \u2581this, \u2581case, \u2581is, \u2581a, \u2581percentage, \u2581of, \u2581, 1, 0, %,, \u2581which, \u2581is, \u2581a, \u2581simple, \u2581interest, \u2581rate, ., \u2581The, \u2581formula, \u2581for, \u2581calculating, \u2581the, \u2581interest, \u2581is, :, <0x0A>, <0x0A>, Inter, est, \u2581=, \u2581Princi, pal, \u2581x, \u2581R, ate, \u2581x, \u2581Time, \u2581/, \u2581, 1, 0, 0, <0x0A>, <0x0A>, In, \u2581this, \u2581case, ,, \u2581the, \u2581principal, \u2581amount, \u2581is, \u2581$, 1, 2, 0, 0, ,, \u2581the, \u2581rate, \u2581of, \u2581interest, \u2581is, \u2581, 1, 0, %, \u2581or, \u2581, 0, ., 1, 0, ,, \u2581and, \u2581the, \u2581time, \u2581period, \u2581is, \u2581not, \u2581mentioned, ,, \u2581so, \u2581we, ', ll, \u2581assume, \u2581it, \u2581to, \u2581be, \u2581one, \u2581year, \u2581for, \u2581the, \u2581sake, \u2581of, \u2581calculation, ., <0x0A>, <0x0A>, There, fore, ,, \u2581the, \u2581interest, \u2581amount, \u2581will, \u2581be, \u2581calculated, \u2581as, :, <0x0A>, <0x0A>, Inter, est, \u2581=, \u2581$, 1, 2, 0, 0, \u2581x, \u2581, 0, ., 1, 0, \u2581x, \u2581, 1, \u2581/, \u2581, 1, 0, 0, <0x0A>, <0x0A>, Inter, est, \u2581=, \u2581$, 1, 2, 0, 0, \u2581x, \u2581, 0, ., 0, 1, <0x0A>, <0x0A>, Inter, est, \u2581=, \u2581$, 1, 2, 0, <0x0A>, <0x0A>, There, fore, ,, \u2581Jack, \u2581has, \u2581to, \u2581pay, \u2581back, \u2581$, 1, 2, 0, \u2581to, \u2581J, ill, \u2581as, \u2581well, \u2581as, \u2581the, \u2581original, \u2581$, 1, 2, 0, 0, ., <0x0A>, ####, \u2581, 1, 2, 0, <0x0A>, </s>", "", 0.0, 292], [255, "<s> [MATH_TASK] Problem:\nKiki likes to spend her money on hats and scarves.
